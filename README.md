Quick Start React Project
---

Hi - this is a quick start build for a react project, will be useful for setting up a new project from scratch using webpack, express and react router.


Usage
---

Start the development server with this command:

```
npm start
```

In a separate tab or terminal, run the following to get styles updating automatically using grunt:

```
grunt
```

You will need to cancel and re-run grunt whenever you make a javascript change, as I have not added js checker to my Gruntfile yet. If you do this feel free to do a pull request and I'll update it.
